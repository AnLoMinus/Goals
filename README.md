# How to write SMART Goals
- **S**: [Specific](https://github.com/Anlominus/Studies/blob/main/Time%20Management.md#s-specific) Well defined, clear, and unambiguous
- **M**: [Measurable](https://github.com/Anlominus/Studies/blob/main/Time%20Management.md#m-measurable) With specific criteria that measure your progress toward the accomplishment of the goal
- **A**: [Actionable](https://github.com/Anlominus/Studies/blob/main/Time%20Management.md#a-achievable) Attainable and not impossible to achieve
- **R**: [Relevant](https://github.com/Anlominus/Studies/blob/main/Time%20Management.md#r-relevant) Within reach, realistic, and relevant to your life purpose
- **T**: [Time Bound](https://github.com/Anlominus/Studies/blob/main/Time%20Management.md#t-time-bound) With a clearly defined timeline, including a starting date and a target date. The purpose is to create urgency.
